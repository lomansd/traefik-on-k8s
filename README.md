Traefik on Kubernetes
---------------------

This repo contains my journey to come to a mTls connection using Traefik on Kubernetes.

Just clone this repository and follow the ASCIIDoc instruction. Easiest way to read the docs is to use a ASCIIDoc plugin for your favorite IDE and start with the `installation.adoc` file.

There is also a `pdf` available in the pdf folder.
