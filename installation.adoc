= Installation of Traefik on an kubernetes (k8s) cluster.

Before you start make sure you have `helm` installed.

[NOTE]
====
For the examples the url `\*.traefik.demo` is used. Be sure to add `*.traefik.demo` to you host(s) file, e.g. `127.0.0.1 *.traefik.demo`

When reading the trying the examples I assue you change to the directory of the example.
